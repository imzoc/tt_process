# Tigress Test Process
This repository contains Python scripts I'm writing for Dr. Christian Collberg. It utilizes [Tigress](https://tigress.wtf/) and another program called Tigress_Test, which runs Tigress and generates data about it stored in JSON.

My goals for this are twofold: learn advanced functionality for Python and packages like scikit-learn (I'm a relative beginner), and write useful code for Dr. Collberg.
